<p>This is a multicolor version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>, where each live cell belongs to one of several <strong>houses</strong> (represented by non-grayscale colors) or is neutral (represented by gray).</p>
<p>The rules regarding life and death follow the original Game of Life rules (<code>S23/B3</code>). Colors evolve as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a live cell stays alive, it will retain its color unless its neighboring live cells were all from the same house — in that case, the cell switches to the same house;</li>
<li>If a dead cell becomes alive, it will become gray, unless a clear majority of its neighboring live cells came from some common house (or when there was only one house of origin among them) — in that case, the cell joins the same house.</li>
</ul></div>

| From far, from eve and morning
|     And yon twelve-winded sky,
| The stuff of life to knit me
|     Blew hither: here am I.
|
| Now — for a breath I tarry
|     Nor yet disperse apart —
| Take my hand quick and tell me,
|     What have you in your heart.
|
| Speak now, and I will answer;
|     How shall I help you, say;
| Ere to the wind's twelve quarters
|     I take my endless way.
|
| — A. E. Housman
