<div class="article"><hgroup><time datetime="2023-04-28">2023-04-28</time><h1>Saphyra: the Beginning</h1></hgroup><p>A few years earlier I started developing <a href="https://github.com/pennzht/saphyra"><strong>Saphyra</strong></a> for fun (called <a href="https://github.com/pennzht/saphira">Saphira</a> then). My main goal was to build a simple proof assistant with a minimal kernel supporting multiple theories. I wanted to see how hard it was, both to build a proof assistant and to write proofs in it.</p>
<p>I restarted the project last year after a three-year hiatus, out of a desire to occupy myself with side projects on weekends. It's a “big clean problem” — one with a very clear goal, plenty of challenges, and an abundance of learning and experimenting opportunities.</p>
<p>Saphyra aims to be a proof assistant, similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizar_system">Mizar</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOL_(proof_assistant)">HOL</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq">Coq</a>. The program helps the user to write formal proofs of mathematical theorems that can be automatically verified, and the proof-writing process is also aided by some level of automation.</p>
<p>I aim to make Saphyra …</p>
<ul>
<li>lean:<ul>
<li>The kernel — the program that checks the validity and rigor of proofs — should not exceed 1000 lines of code. The more code you have, the harder it is to verify its correctness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>extensible:<ul>
<li>The system should be easy to extend to support a wide range of logics: classical, intuitionistic, modal, linear; first-order, second-order, higher-order; set theories, type theories, category theories; and other user-defined systems of reasoning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>meta:<ul>
<li>The system should be able to prove relations <em>between theories</em>, such as that any EFA theorem is also a PRA theorem, and that ZFC proves the consistency of PA. To do this, we would use a relatively weak theory (such as EFA, PRA, PA, or ZF minus ∞) to show how proofs may be converted between theories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>easy to use:<ul>
<li>Usability may be improved many ways: using a familiar (Python- or Java-like) syntax; providing analysis tools; training AIs to observe common patterns in proofs; and many others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

| From far, from eve and morning
|     And yon twelve-winded sky,
| The stuff of life to knit me
|     Blew hither: here am I.
|
| Now — for a breath I tarry
|     Nor yet disperse apart —
| Take my hand quick and tell me,
|     What have you in your heart.
|
| Speak now, and I will answer;
|     How shall I help you, say;
| Ere to the wind's twelve quarters
|     I take my endless way.
