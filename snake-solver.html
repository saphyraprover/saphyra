<p>Here is a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)">Snake</a> game, where the snake is controlled by the computer. Click to add bits of food for the snake.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Thanks to two simple tricks.</p>
<p>The first trick stemmed from a simple heuristic: a good snake, one who never traps itself, usually slithers in <strong>alternating directions</strong> on consecutive rows or columns. If it went left on the last row, it would go right on this row; and if it went up on the last column, it would go down on this column.</p>
<p>We built our snake to <strong>strictly follow</strong> this rule: on even-numbered columns (starting from zero), it will always go down; whereas on odd-numbered columns, always goes up. A similar rule follows for rows. To the snake, the field looks like this, where each segment is walkable in only one direction:</p>
<p class="controls"><span id="ctrls2">JS and SVG support required.</span></p>
<p class="snake"><svg class="snake" id="svg2"></svg></p>

<p>Note that each corner has exactly one incoming edge and one outgoing edge.</p>
<p>On a field with even width and height, it is provable that such a snake never goes into a dead end, where all paths ahead are walls or its own body.</p>
<p>The second trick is about knowing the future. When the snake is plotting its path, it carries out a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth-first search</a> on the directed graph shown above, stopping the search when food is found. When the search runs into a piece of the snake's body, the algorithm checks whether this piece would still be there when the head arrives — because sometimes this part of the snake moves away when that time comes.</p>
<p>Here you can see the snake's search tree (select “All”) and the path it determined (select “Shortest”):</p>
<p class="controls"><span id="ctrls3">JS and SVG support required.</span></p>
<p class="snake"><svg class="snake" id="svg3"></svg></p>

<p>Combining the two tricks, we have a snake who will devour any bits of food available, filling the field so that no more food can be dropped.</p>
<p>The solver, 60 lines of JavaScript determining the snake's moves, is available at <a href="/js/snake.js">js/snake.js § lines 89–148</a>.</p></div>

| From far, from eve and morning
|     And yon twelve-winded sky,
| The stuff of life to knit me
|     Blew hither: here am I.

| Now — for a breath I tarry
|     Nor yet disperse apart —
| Take my hand quick and tell me,
|     What have you in your heart.
|
| Speak now, and I will answer;
|     How shall I help you, say;
| Ere to the wind's twelve quarters
|     I take my endless way.
